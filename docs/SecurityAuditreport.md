# Security Audit Report

## Security Measures
- **Data Encryption**:
  - All sensitive patient data is encrypted using AES-256 before temporary storage.
- **Token Storage**:
  - API tokens are stored as environment variables, minimizing exposure.

## Risk Assessment
- **Unauthorized Export Access**:
  - Risk: Potential unauthorized data access if passcode leaked.
  - Mitigation: Ensure passcodes are rotated regularly and only accessible to verified healthcare providers.
- **Data in Transit**:
  - Risk: Data transmitted over WhatsApp may be vulnerable.
  - Mitigation: Implement HTTPS for all webhook communications.

## Vulnerability Testing
- **Encryption Validation**:
  - Tested AES encryption using test data to confirm security.
- **Access Control**:
  - Verified that unauthorized users cannot access the export functionality.

## Suggested Enhancements
- **Two-Factor Authentication**:
  - Recommend adding 2FA for healthcare providers accessing data exports.
- **Audit Logs**:
  - Logging each export request to monitor and audit data access.
